## **Project Summary**

**Objective**: Develop a centralized management system in Go (Golang) to orchestrate language model serving engines (e.g., Hugging Face TGI, VLLM, LLAMA.CPP) across multiple servers with GPU or CPU capabilities.

---

## **Key Components and Decisions**

### **1. Resource Registration**

- **Agent-Based Architecture**:
  - **Deployment**: Agents will be installed on each server. Initial deployment can be automated using SSH.
  - **Configuration**: Agents will be configured with the master node's endpoint.
  - **Communication**: Post-deployment, communication between agents and the master node will occur via APIs.

### **2. User Interaction**

- **Control Interface**:
  - **REST API**: All functionalities will be exposed through a RESTful API.
  - **Future Expansion**: A web UI can be developed later for management purposes.

### **3. Model Management**

- **Master Node Responsibility**:
  - **Model Downloading**: Master node handles downloading models either directly from Hugging Face or from specified folders.
  - **Optimized Downloader**: Utilize your existing tool for efficient model downloading, avoiding reliance on the Hugging Face `.cache` folder.
  
### **4. Security Considerations**

- **Master-Agent Communication**:
  - **Security Protocols**: Implement robust security methods to secure communication (e.g., TLS/SSL encryption, token-based authentication).
  
- **Client Interaction with Engines**:
  - **OpenAI API Compliance**: Follow OpenAI's API standards for clients interacting with the running engines.
  - **Authentication**: Implement methods and tokens similar to OpenAI's approach.

### **5. Logging and Monitoring**

- **Crucial for System Health**:
  - **Load Monitoring**: Agents report server loads (CPU, GPU, memory) back to the master node.
  - **Logging**: System logs for operations, errors, and performance metrics.

### **6. Timeframe and Resources**

- **Development Team**: Solo development (you).
- **Support**: I'm here to assist you throughout the process.

  - Manages running instances and resource allocation.

- **Security Module**:
  - Manages secure communication protocols with agents.
  - Handles authentication for clients per OpenAI API standards.

- **Monitoring and Logging Service**:
  - Collects logs and metrics from agents.
  - Provides alerts for abnormal conditions.

### **B. Agent (on Each Server)**

- **API Client**:
  - Communicates with the master node.
  - Receives commands and reports status.

- **Engine Manager**:
  - Handles starting, stopping, and updating engine Docker containers.
  - Ensures engines are running with the correct models and parameters.

- **Resource Monitor**:
  - Continuously monitors system resources (CPU, GPU, memory usage).
  - Sends periodic reports to the master node.

- **Security Module**:
  - Maintains secure communication with the master node.
  - Validates and authenticates commands received.

### **C. Clients**

- **External Users/Applications**:
  - Interact with the deployed engines via standardized APIs.
  - Use authentication tokens as per OpenAI's specifications.

## **Technology Stack**

- **Programming Language**: Go (Golang).

- **Containerization**:
  - **Docker**: For running engine instances.
  - **Docker SDK for Go**: To manage containers programmatically.

- **Communication**:
  - **gRPC or RESTful APIs**: For efficient communication between master and agents.
  - **Security**: Implement TLS for encrypted communication.

- **Data Storage**:
  - **Database**: Use a database like PostgreSQL or etcd for storing configurations, statuses, and logs.

- **Logging and Monitoring**:
  - **Logging Libraries**: Use `logrus` or `zap` for structured logging.
  - **Monitoring Tools**: Integrate with Prometheus for metrics collection; use Grafana for visualization.

- **Security Libraries**:
  - **Authentication**: Use packages like `jwt-go` for token handling.
  - **Encryption**: Use Go's standard `crypto/tls` package.

## **Questions for Clarification**

1. **Agent Updates**:

   - **Automatic Updates**: Should agents have the capability to update themselves automatically when a new version is available?
   - **Master-Initiated Updates**: Do you prefer that the master node pushes updates to agents?

2. **Model Storage Location**:

   - **Centralized vs. Distributed**: Should models be stored centrally and distributed on-demand, or should agents download and store models locally?
   - **Storage Management**: How should disk space and model storage be managed on the agents?

3. **Concurrent Engine Instances**:

   - **Multiple Models per Agent**: Do we need to support running multiple models or engine instances on a single server?
   - **Resource Allocation**: How should resources be allocated when running multiple instances?

4. **API Standards and Documentation**:

   - **OpenAPI Specification**: Shall we use OpenAPI/Swagger for API design and documentation?
   - **Versioning**: How will API versions be managed over time?

5. **Error Handling and Retries**:

   - **Communication Failures**: Define the retry logic and error handling for master-agent communications.
   - **Agent Failures**: How should the master node respond if an agent becomes unresponsive?

6. **Client Authentication Details**:

   - **Token Generation**: How will tokens for clients be generated and managed?
   - **Permissions and Roles**: Do we need to consider different permission levels for clients?
